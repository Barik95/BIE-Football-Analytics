Football Analytics Project


Project Overview
This project focuses on building an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline using Python to gather, process, and load football data from an API into a PostgreSQL database. The data pipeline is automated using Docker, ensuring that the process is both repeatable and scalable.

Problem Statement
We aim to utilize a football data API to fetch data, perform transformations, enforce data quality checks, and finally load the processed data into a PostgreSQL database. The entire process is automated using Docker to ensure consistent deployment across different environments.

Tech Stack
Python: Core language for the ETL pipeline.
PostgreSQL: Database for storing the transformed data.
Docker: For containerization of the ETL process.
Docker Compose: To manage multi-container Docker applications.
Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of APIs.
Understanding of Docker and Docker Compose.
Intermediate Python and SQL skills.
Basic understanding of PostgreSQL and its connection to applications.
Learning Outcomes
By the end of this project, you will:

Understand how to interact with an API to retrieve data.
Learn how to handle data using Pandas DataFrames.
Set up PostgreSQL and Docker Compose to manage the environment.
Automate the entire data pipeline using Docker.

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Setting Up the Environment
Before running the project, ensure Docker is installed on your machine. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Extracting Data
The apiload.py script connects to the football data API, extracts the data for the specified seasons, and saves the data as JSON files.

3. Transforming Data
Each of the pgload_* scripts performs transformations on the data extracted by apiload.py. These scripts clean the data, enforce data quality checks, and prepare it for loading into the PostgreSQL database.

4. Loading Data
The cleaned and transformed data is then loaded into the PostgreSQL database. The tables include team data, match data, standings, and top scorers.

5. Automation with Docker
The project is fully automated using Docker. The docker-compose.yml file defines the services:

db: The PostgreSQL database service.
api_loader: Extracts data from the API.
table_loader_1 to table_loader_4: Sequentially run the transformation and loading scripts.
To run the entire pipeline, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up
6. Querying the Data
Once the data is loaded into the PostgreSQL database, you can query it using a tool like pgAdmin or directly from the terminal.

7. Validation and Quality Checks
Data quality checks are embedded in the transformation scripts, ensuring that the data loaded into the database is clean and conforms to the specified constraints.

Deployment
To deploy the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DE-football.git
cd DE-football
Build and run the Docker containers:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
The PostgreSQL database will be available at localhost:5432, and you can connect using your preferred PostgreSQL client.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build and automate a data pipeline using Python and Docker. By following the steps outlined, you will learn how to interact with APIs, handle data transformations, and automate the deployment of your pipeline.

Future Enhancements
Error Handling: Improve the error handling in the ETL scripts to make the pipeline more robust.
Scheduling: Implement a scheduling mechanism, such as cron jobs, to automate the pipeline at regular intervals.
Logging: Add logging to capture detailed information about the ETL process for better monitoring and debugging.
